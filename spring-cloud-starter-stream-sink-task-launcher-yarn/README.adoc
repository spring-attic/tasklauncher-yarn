= TaskLauncher YARN Sink

This application launches the task application specified in the uri attribute of the `TaskLaunchRequest` contained
in the message that is received.

Any message that does not contain a `TaskLaunchRequest` will log an error.

== Input

=== Headers:

* `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`

=== Payload:

A  byte array containing the `TaskLaunchRequest`

NOTE: The `TaskLaunchRequest` contains the URI of the task jar, the command line arguments, and properties required for the task launch.

== Output

N/A 

== Using the TaskLauncher
A tasklauncher is a sink that consumes a `TaskLaunchRequest` message, deploys and launches a task using a Spring
Cloud Deployer.  The task will use the --uri from the message to determine what artifact to deploy as well as the
properties and arguments to execute the task.  An example of this using Spring Cloud Data Flow would look like this:

`stream create foo --definition "triggertask --uri=maven://org.springframework.cloud.task.app:timestamp-task:jar:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT --fixed-delay=5 | tasklauncher-yarn"`

Another example would be to use a processor to translate a message from another source into a `TaskLaunchRequest` that
would be sent to the tasklauncher sink.

== Limitations
Currently `tasklauncher-yarn` sink only works on Dataflow for Apache Yarn and yarn deployer version in this sink has to match same version used in a dataflow server.

== Build

```
$ ./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps
$ cd apps
```
You can find the corresponding binder based projects here. You can then cd into one one of the folders and
build it:
```
$ ./mvnw clean package
```

=== Examples

```
java -jar task-launcher-yarn.jar
```
